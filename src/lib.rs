//! SocketCAN support.
//!
//! The Linux kernel supports using CAN-devices through a network-like API
//! (see https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/can.txt). This
//! crate allows easy access to this functionality without having to wrestle
//! libc calls.
//!
//! # An introduction to CAN
//!
//! The CAN bus was originally designed to allow microcontrollers inside a
//! vehicle to communicate over a single shared bus. Messages called
//! *frames* are multicast to all devices on the bus.
//!
//! Every frame consists of an ID and a payload of up to 8 bytes. If two
//! devices attempt to send a frame at the same time, the device with the
//! higher ID will notice the conflict, stop sending and reattempt to sent its
//! frame in the next time slot. This means that the lower the ID, the higher
//! the priority. Since most devices have a limited buffer for outgoing frames,
//! a single device with a high priority (== low ID) can block communication
//! on that bus by sending messages too fast.
//!
//! The Linux socketcan subsystem makes the CAN bus available as a regular
//! networking device. Opening an network interface allows receiving all CAN
//! messages received on it. A device CAN be opened multiple times, every
//! client will receive all CAN frames simultaneously.
//!
//! Similarly, CAN frames can be sent to the bus by multiple client
//! simultaneously as well.
//!
//! # Hardware and more information
//!
//! More information on CAN [can be found on Wikipedia](). When not running on
//! an embedded platform with already integrated CAN components,
//! [Thomas Fischl's USBtin](http://www.fischl.de/usbtin/) (see
//! [section 2.4](http://www.fischl.de/usbtin/#socketcan)) is one of many ways
//! to get started.
//!
//! # RawFd
//!
//! Raw access to the underlying file descriptor and construction through
//! is available through the `AsRawFd`, `IntoRawFd` and `FromRawFd`
//! implementations.
